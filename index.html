        <p> Hi welcome to my blog, my name is Azeem, I am 16 years old, I study in Sarasas Witaed Bangbon school. I love to play
        video games and create websites and I created this website using HTML and CSS. I learned to write code in HTML from
        teacher Ata. Teacher Ata is the best computer teacher for me because he explains everything very well and he
        makes difficult things very easy to understand and if teacher Ata is reading this I just want to say you are my favorite
        teacher and to everyone else thank you for reading my short blog and if you want to contact me than hit  the contact
        button down below.</p>
